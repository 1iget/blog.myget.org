<p>We’ve supported the <a href="http://docs.myget.org/docs/reference/package-sources#Scenario_-_Pushing_a_package_upstream">“Push upstream” workflow</a> for quite a while now. This workflow allows you to promote packages from one feed to another, ideal when you are pushing prerelease packages on one feed and pushing them as stable packages to another feed after testing them.’</p> <p>So far, it has been only possible to push individual packages upstream, or all “latest” packages. We realized this was painful for one scenario: if you’re usign Build Services, it may be handy to be able to push just the packages generated by a specific build. And that is exactly what we’ve added now!</p> <p><a href="/images/image_99.png"><img width="640" height="413" title="Promoting packages generated duing build" style="border: 0px currentColor; border-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; background-image: none;" alt="Promoting packages generated duing build" src="/images/image_thumb_97.png" border="0"></a></p> <p>When expanding a build’s packages, a new menu entry <em>Push upstream…</em>is now available to push the packages generated by a build to another feed. This should greatly improve usability for this scenario.</p> <p><em>Happy packaging!</em></p>
