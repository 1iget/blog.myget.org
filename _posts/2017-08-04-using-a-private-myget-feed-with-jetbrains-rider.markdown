At MyGet, we’ve been using Rider for our internal development <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2016/01/13/project-rider-a-csharp-ide/">since it was announced</a>. So far, we have really enjoyed this IDE built around ReSharper! And since it comes with a lightning-fast NuGet client, let’s see how we can <a href="https://www.myget.org/">consume packages from a MyGet feed</a>.</p><p></p><h2>Adding a MyGet feed package source</h2><p>The first step in connecting Rider to a MyGet feed is adding it as a package source. We can do this using NuGet.exe (via good old <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/schema/nuget-config-file#package-source-sections">NuGet.config</a>), or from within Rider. From the <strong>NuGet tool window</strong>, open the <strong>Sources</strong> tab. This will show us all of the NuGet configuration files that are in play, and a list of all feeds configured.</p><p><a href="/images/image25.png"><img width="800" height="226" title="image25" style="border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; display: inline; background-image: none;" alt="image25" src="/images/image25_thumb.png" border="0"></a></p><p>From here, we can add our MyGet feed (or edit an existing entry). We will have to give our feed a name so we can easily recognize it in Rider, and the URL to our feed. This URL can be found on the MyGet feed details page after logging in to <a href="http://www.myget.org/">www.myget.org</a>.</p><p><a href="/images/image31.png"><img width="395" height="204" title="image31" style="border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; display: inline; background-image: none;" alt="image31" src="/images/image31_thumb.png" border="0"></a></p><p>The NuGet client in Rider supports working with public and private MyGet feeds. While Rider supports using pre-authenticated feeds as well as feeds that require entering credentials, we recommend using the latter. Rider safely stores our MyGet username/password in its <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/passwords.html">password store</a>, which is <a href="http://keepass.info/">based on KeePass</a>.</p><p>Using MyGet together with JetBrains Rider makes it possible to develop .NET applications and let your development team consume both public and private packages hosted securely on MyGet.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider"><strong>Download Rider</strong></a> for Windows, macOS or Linux, and take it for a 30-day trial.</li><li><a href="https://www.myget.org/"><strong>Create a MyGet account</strong></a> to securely work with private NuGet feeds, and <a href="https://www.myget.org/Subscription/SignUp/MG001">get a 14-day trial</a>.</li></ul><p><em>Happy packaging!</em></p>
