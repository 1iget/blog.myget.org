<p>The <a href="https://www.myget.org/gallery">MyGet Gallery</a> contains a collection of interesting feeds where open-source projects and software vendors share their NuGet, npm, Bower and VSIX packages with the world. Most often the packages in the gallery are nightly builds or preview versions, so we can keep our projects on the cutting edge of technology using the latest dependencies.</p> <p>We just deployed some improvements to the gallery details page:</p> <ul> <li>We now display the feedâ€™s README, where we render Markdown and the feed owner can provide additional information like links to GitHub, documentation and so on.</li> <li>Underneath, the list of packages on the feed is shown, including a description. We also added a search box so we can do a quick search across the packages listed on the feed.</li> <li>The top bar has a <strong>Connect to Feed</strong> button, which will provide connection details to, for example, connect to the feed from Visual Studio or npm.</li></ul> <p><a href="/images/image_152.png"><img width="800" height="627" title="Using nightly builds for MongoDB" style="border: 0px currentColor; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Using nightly builds for MongoDB" src="/images/image_thumb_147.png" border="0"></a></p> <p>Have a look at the feeds in the <a href="https://www.myget.org/gallery">MyGet Gallery</a>, and let us know what you think using the comments below or <a href="https://www.twitter.com/MyGetTeam">via Twitter</a>.</p> <p><em>Happy packaging!</em></p>
