<p>MyGet has a rich feature set for NuGet, and we just recently <a href="/post/2015/03/16/MyGet-now-offers-NuGet-Npm-and-Bower-registries.aspx" target="_blank">added support for Bower and NPM registries</a>. Now we'd like to give our users the opportunity to bring those rich MyGet features to VSIX as well!</p><h3><span style="line-height: 1.4285;">What VSIX support will you get in this preview?</span></h3><p>We currently have the full feature set we already have for NuGet, Bower and NPM. You'll be able to manage extensions, add them from upstream feeds (ATOM only), granular permissions and user management, support for community feeds... If you need a staging feed or just a private VSIX gallery, this is the easiest way to get one. Using the VSO integration? We'll pick up the VSIX artifacts from your VSO build and automatically add them to your MyGet VSIX feed.</p><h3>I want to join the preview!</h3><p>If you are interested in joining the private preview and eager to provide some early feedback, then just&nbsp;<a style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" href="https://www.myget.org/Support" target="_blank">ping us with your username</a>&nbsp;and we'll flip the feature toggle for your account.</p>
