<p>All <a href="https://www.myget.org/enterprise">MyGet Enterprise</a> subscriptions feature a complete “copy” of MyGet, tailored to your organization’s development team. A custom URL provides access to private repositories used by your team. But what if you want to make a specific feed available to the general audience? And how can private feeds within the organization be easily discovered by team members?</p> <p>The answer to these two questions? The MyGet Gallery. It serves as the Golden Pages for your team’s NuGet feeds. Through the feed settings, a feed can be listed in the gallery, complete with a readme and icon.</p> <p><a href="/images/image_81.png"><img width="640" height="459" title="Adding a feed to the gallery" style="border: 0px currentColor; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; background-image: none;" alt="Adding a feed to the gallery" src="/images/image_thumb_79.png" border="0"></a></p> <p>Only public and community feeds will be shown in the public MyGet Gallery. Feeds that are public <em>within</em> your team will only be shown in the MyGet Gallery for authenticated users. This makes the MyGet Gallery a great place to discover feeds! Your customers can browse the MyGet Gallery and see which feeds they can use. Team members will see feeds that are only available within the organization and can have a look, too.</p> <p><a href="/images/image_82.png"><img width="522" height="226" title="MyGet Gallery" style="border: 0px currentColor; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; background-image: none;" alt="MyGet Gallery" src="/images/image_thumb_80.png" border="0"></a></p> <p>And if you want to disable the MyGet Gallery? Simply use the administration dashboard to do so.</p> <p><a href="/images/image_83.png"><img width="640" height="232" title="Disable gallery" style="border: 0px currentColor; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; background-image: none;" alt="Disable gallery" src="/images/image_thumb_81.png" border="0"></a></p> <p><em>Happy packaging!</em></p>
