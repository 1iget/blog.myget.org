Follow <a href="http://www.twitter.com/MyGetTeam">@MyGetTeam on Twitter</a> for more!</p><h2>NuGet news</h2><p><a href="http://www.myget.org/nuget"><strong><img width="195" height="194" title="NuGet news, curated by MyGet" align="right" style="border-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; float: right; display: inline; background-image: none;" alt="NuGet news, curated by MyGet" src="/images/image_150.png" border="0"></strong></a>The NuGet team <a href="http://blog.nuget.org/20161027/Announcing-NuGet-3.5-RTM.html">just released NuGet 3.5</a>, with mostly performance improvements, features and new target frameworks like netstandard and netcoreapp. The performance improvement during package restore is phenomenal, definitely worth upgrading. And you can now package <a href="http://semver.org/">SemVer 2.0</a> packages as well (and publish them to MyGet).<br></p><p>They also published&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.nuget.org/20161121/introducing-nuget4.0.html">a release candidate of 4.0</a>, with support for adding NuGet references in the project file. Which is great as we can now use MSBuild variables in our dependency definitions.<br></p><p>More releases at Microsoft's Connect conference. There's <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio 2017 RC</a> as well as <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windowscmd">a new .NET Core version (1.1)</a>.<br></p><p>Armin Reiter wrote a post titled <a href="https://codehollow.com/2016/11/powershell-package-management-nuget-chocolatey-co/#comment-325">Powershell package management – NuGet, Chocolatey and Co</a>.

Interesting finds, for example a package that phones home after being installed.<br></p><p>In <a href="https://nodesource.com/blog/seven-more-npm-tricks-to-knock-your-wombat-socks-off">7 npm tricks to knock your wombat socks off</a>, Tierney Coren describes a couple of tips and tricks with the npm command line. For example adding npm completion under bash, or making sure packages you install actually work with the current Node version using "engine-strict".<br></p><p>Elijah Manor and his team started exploring <a href="http://elijahmanor.com/npm-precommit-scripts/">running npm scripts in a git pre-commit hook</a> and run linting before a commit. This technique ensures no invalid JavaScript code can be committed to source control.</p><p>If you have any news to share or have other feedback, let us know using the comments below or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/MyGetTeam">reach out on Twitter</a>.</p><p><em>Happy packaging!</em></p>
