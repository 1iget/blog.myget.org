<p>We’re happy to announce that MyGet Build Services is in Public Beta since, well, now. MyGet Build Services enable you to add packages to your feed by just giving us your Git, Mercurial or Subversion repo. We build it, we package it, we publish it. And starting today, every MyGet user can use it.</p>  <p>More information on MyGet Build Services can be found in a <a href="/post/2012/08/22/MyGet-Build-Services-Join-the-private-beta!.aspx">previous blog post</a>, although some things have been updated. You’ve provided us feedback through our <a href="http://myget.uservoice.com/">UserVoice</a>, resulting in the following changes:</p>  <ul>   <li>We now support .NET Framework 4.5. New features available in .NET Framework 4.5 are described at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/ms171868.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/ms171868.aspx</a>. </li>    <li>Build hooks! The list of your build definitions now shows a build hook URL which you can link to your GitHub or BitBucket repository. Calling this build hook (HTTP POST) will trigger a new build. Or in other words: a commit will trigger a build.</li>    <li>Our build server now checks for a file called build.bat first, then MyGet.sln, then your .sln and then .csproj/.vbproj files (<a title="http://myget.uservoice.com/forums/135675-general/suggestions/3098937-build-services-wonka-should-support-a-build-bat" href="http://myget.uservoice.com/forums/135675-general/suggestions/3098937-build-services-wonka-should-support-a-build-bat">UV</a>) </li>    <li>We now support Git, Mercurial and Subversion repositories (<a title="http://myget.uservoice.com/forums/135675-general/suggestions/3099906-support-bitbucket-org-for-build-services" href="http://myget.uservoice.com/forums/135675-general/suggestions/3099906-support-bitbucket-org-for-build-services">UV</a>) </li>    <li>You’ll now have some tools available in the environment variables (<a title="http://myget.uservoice.com/forums/135675-general/suggestions/3112482-build-services-is-it-possible-to-invoke-git-insid" href="http://myget.uservoice.com/forums/135675-general/suggestions/3112482-build-services-is-it-possible-to-invoke-git-insid">UV</a>) </li>    <li>There’s more information in the build logs (<a title="http://myget.uservoice.com/forums/135675-general/suggestions/3118501-build-services-please-provide-better-build-logs" href="http://myget.uservoice.com/forums/135675-general/suggestions/3118501-build-services-please-provide-better-build-logUV">UV</a>) </li> </ul>  <p>Keep the feedback coming! Build Services are now enabled on every <a href="http://www.myget.org">MyGet</a> account. Do note MyGet Build Services are still a beta, and as Willy Wonka would say… “Little surprises around every corner, but nothing dangerous.”</p>  <p>Happy packaging!</p>  <p>PS: Why not deploy your freshly built apps using <a href="http://octopusdeploy.com/">Octopus Deploy</a>?</p>
