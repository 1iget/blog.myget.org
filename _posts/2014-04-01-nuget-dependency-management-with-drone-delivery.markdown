<p>Using <a href="http://www.myget.org">MyGet</a> just became easier. We are proud to announce a new feature (in preview) which brings&nbsp;a better and bolder way of consuming <a href="http://www.nuget.org">NuGet</a> packages from your feed! Next to using Visual Studio or the NuGet command line tool to have packages delivered to your project, it is now possible to have packages delivered by drones using the new Drone Delivery feature.</p> <p>Many established companies, as well as startups, are experimenting with drones for their services. MyGet will be the first to offer dependency management using this approach. And for good reasons:&nbsp;the Drone Delivery feature will make package restore a breeze even if you lose your Internet connection.</p><p>Hereâ€™s an overview of how Drone Delivery works:</p> <p><a href="/images/image_93.png"><img width="527" height="217" title="How drone delivery works" style="border: 0px currentColor; border-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="How drone delivery works" src="/images/image_thumb_91.png" border="0"></a></p> <p>The new Drone Delivery feature will surface in many places throughout the MyGet website, for example on package details pages and in the <a href="https://www.myget.org/gallery">MyGet Gallery</a>. It is also possible to consume all packages from a feed using Drone Delivery:</p> <p><a href="/images/image_94.png"><img width="640" height="203" title="Drone Delivery of an entire feed" style="border: 0px currentColor; border-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Drone Delivery of an entire feed" src="/images/image_thumb_92.png" border="0"></a></p> <p>We're really excited about this feature and will be adding additional capabilities in the future. We are thinking about Google Glass apps&nbsp;and Oculus VR support to&nbsp;enable tracking package delivery in real time.</p><p>More information on this new feature can be found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day">in our documentation</a>. If you want the preview of Drone Delivery enabled for your account, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day">let us know</a>.</p> <p><em>Happy packaging!</em></p>
