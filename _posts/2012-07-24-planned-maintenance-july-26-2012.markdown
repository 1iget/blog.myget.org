<p>We are planning a small window of maintenance on Thursday <strong>July 26</strong>, between <strong>1:00pm and 2:00pm CET</strong>, during which we will roll out an update to the MyGet Web site.</p>
<p>During that timeframe, we will disable any synchronization we have in place with SymbolSource. Synchronization will pick up after our deployment.</p>
<p>We expect <strong>no</strong> other interruptions in service during this time frame, except for maybe a few seconds when switching VIPs.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
