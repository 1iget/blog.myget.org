We’ve always been very focused on building a great story around NuGet and decided it was time for Npm and Bower enthusiasts to get a similar experience.</p> <p>Adding npm and Bower support was high on our wish list and that of our users. Many developers are doing only front-end development and need a public or private npm registry. Others are working with DNX (the new name for ASP.NET 5 or ASP.NET vNext) and combine NuGet, npm and Bower. It feels good to be able to support them all!</p> <p>To help you get started, we’ve prepared a few short tutorials that help you get started on MyGet with these package managers:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://docs.myget.org/docs/walkthrough/getting-started-with-nuget">Getting Started with NuGet</a></li> <li><a href="http://docs.myget.org/docs/walkthrough/getting-started-with-npm">Getting Started with npm</a></li> <li><a href="http://docs.myget.org/docs/walkthrough/getting-started-with-bower">Getting Started with Bower</a></li></ul> <p>Oh and build services now also packages node modules! Just point MyGet to your GitHub repository and we’ll package your npm packages, too.</p> <p>We really look forward to hearing&nbsp;your feedback on this!</p> <p><em>Happy packaging!</em></p>
