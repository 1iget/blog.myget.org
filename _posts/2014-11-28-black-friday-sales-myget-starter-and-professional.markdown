MyGet could have never grown into what it is today without you. We'd like to thank you by having a sale on our <a href="https://www.myget.org/plans">Starter and Professional plans</a>!</p> <p><strong>Starter and Professional Subscriptions of 6 months get a 15% discount. If you decide to stay with us for a full year, we’ll give you 30% off!</strong></p> <p>Interested? Sign in to <a href="https://www.myget.org/profile/Me#!/Subscription">your MyGet account</a> and create a new subscription or extend your existing one.</p> <p>Since today is “Black Friday” and right after the weekend is “Cyber Monday”, we’re keeping this sale available until Tuesday December 2nd, 2014. This gives ample opportunity to purchase a MyGet subscription at a discounted rate.</p> <p><em>Happy packaging!</em></p><p>PS: Give our new features a try, too.
