This is our second partnership with them, since we also <a href="/post/2014/05/12/Announcing-Visual-Studio-Online-integration.aspx">integrate with Visual Studio Online</a>. The Microsoft Azure Cloud is widely used to build and deliver applications to end-users. Developing these applications could greatly benefit from using a package management solution to streamline development, and that’s where <a href="http://www.myget.org">MyGet</a> comes in.</p> <p>Having MyGet available in the Microsoft Azure Store allows developers and team leads to create MyGet accounts for themselves or their team members, whether free or one of the <a href="http://www.myge.org/plans">paid plans</a>. There are no separate bills to be paid: MyGet will be part of the monthly account statement or Enterprise Agreement.</p> <p><a href="/images/image_104.png"><img width="304" height="200" title="image" align="right" style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 5px; border: 0px currentColor; border-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; float: right; display: inline; background-image: none;" alt="image" src="/images/image_thumb_102.png" border="0"></a>If you are a Microsoft Azure customer, here’s how to create a new MyGet account:</p> <ol> <li>Go to the <a href="http://manage.windowsazure.com">Microsoft Azure Management Portal</a></li> <li>In the bottom toolbar, click <strong>New</strong> and select <strong>Store</strong></li> <li>In the <strong>Choose an Add-on</strong> dialog, select <strong>MyGet </strong>and click next</li> <li>In the <strong>Personalize Add-on</strong> dialog select the <strong>MyGet </strong>plan you want to sign up for.</li> <li>If you want to create one (or more) paid subscriptions, you can use the promotional code <font face="Courier New">STORELAUNCH</font>, which will give you a 25% discount during the first 6 months of the subscription (code valid until end of August, 2014).</li> <li>Once the subscription is created, click <strong>Manage</strong> in the bottom toolbar and pick the username and password you wish to use for your MyGet subscription.</li></ol> <p>If you are an existing MyGet user and would like to make use of the Microsoft Azure Store integrated billing, <a href="https://www.myget.org/support">contact support</a> and we will make it happen!</p> <p><em>Happy packaging!</em></p>
